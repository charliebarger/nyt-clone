                        <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with
                            a new son and a year’s
                            appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                            beyond the world of known
                            physics.</p>
                        <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have
                            been created in the Big
                            Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                            potential hitch in the presumed
                            course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
                            exerted a repulsive force, causing
                            the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                        <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from
                            pole to pole and not like a
                            jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                            irregularities. Those particles were
                            not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                        <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
                            around it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ad">

                    <div class="center-wrap">
                        <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                            beginning of the Big Bang, and
                            that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
                        <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at
                            the South Pole, a team of
                            astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
                            ripples in the fabric of
                            space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
                            violently apart when it was
                            roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
                            long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                            inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
                        <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                            wondered whether it could
                            ever be proved.</p>
                        <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the
                            recent discovery of dark energy
                            pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
                            space and energy to science
                            and speculation.</p>
                        <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
                            space with its hundreds of
                            billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                            architecture and fate are
                            unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
                            universes bubbling into frothy
                            eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

                            particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
                            ripples would be the first direct
                            observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general
                            relativity, should ruffle

                        <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
                            that permeates space and
                            preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
